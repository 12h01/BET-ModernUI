# BET-ModernUI

This is a very simple script. The goal is to provide a UI redesign on the Bets mobile site, by using a Custom Script extension in any Chromium-based browser.

## Warning!

This code is hella old. And probably you don't even have any reason to check it. Lol.

Most betting sites today has a nice UI after all.

## ...but if you still want to check it anyway

All the code is contained in the file:
```
config.js
```
and afaik it has comments, but in portuguese only.
